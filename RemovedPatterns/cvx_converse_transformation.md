... how can an economic system be made into a Economic Piston **(EPI)**?


**Many systems are disjointed and volatile by nature.  In order to make these systems thrive, they must be able to not only withstand volatility but thrive off of volatility.  AKA Anti-fragile.**


A fragile system will fail when it meets with volatility.

A robust system will withstand volatility and return to the original state.

a thriving and anti-fragile system will be made stronger with volatility.

These Items are laid out in Taleb's Antifragile.  You should own this book.

Anti fragile systems have a convex lay out in respect to amount of volatility.  As volatility increase, they gain from the change.

If a system is not anti-fragile we should use convex transformation to make it so.

The current economic system has had its trouble with volatility.  If we can, we will try to move toward a system that will be much more agile when dealing with volatility.


Therefore:

**When creating a new economic system, make changes that result in a system that is long volatility.**


----------

Two forms of convex transformation are the Bi-modal Strategy **(BIM)** and Predictive Elimination **(PEL)**.
