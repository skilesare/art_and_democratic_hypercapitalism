# What is missing?

At this point Book I is extremely short.  I'm not the best with logistics and need your help to flesh out the exact generative language to make this a reality.  This book is hosted on github and I accept pull request.  If you have a deep knowledge of the banking system, block chain, technology, financial transaction technology, etc, I'd love for you to help me fill in the blanks.

The steps outlined in Seed To Vision need to be ripped apart and detailed.  In addition, correction strategies need to be explored for when volatility hits the system.

We need help writing the monte carlo simulations out lined in Book II.  If you are a developer and want to help us with the simulation and analysis of the results we would welcome the help.
