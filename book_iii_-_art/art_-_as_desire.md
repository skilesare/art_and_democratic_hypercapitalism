# Art - As Desired

If we had complete power to implement a system of our choice, what would it be and how would it work?

I will define this and discuss how we can create a generative system that results in this system.

## The Center - The Citizen

For me, the first question we must answer is what do we want the 'center' or our system to be?  Is it the market or the corporation like today's system seems to revolve around?  Is it power and control as totalitarian governments have attempted to implement in the past?

The answer that I have arrived at is 'the citizen.'  As I lay out this form of money I will ask the reader to consider each element that is layered on and ask themseleves, 'how does this enhance the citizen at the center of our monetary system?'  Along the way other centers will form around this initial strong center and we want each layer to enhance those sub centers as well.

These ideas are explaind much more thouroughly in [Christopher Alexander's Nature of Order](./about_the_author/on_influences.md).

It is probably worth mentioning why we have not chosen something different as our strongest center.  I will include a few notes, but there is a much longer discussion that could be had about the pluses and minuses of each. It also is not that these items are not centers in our system, just that they are not the strongest center.  They all have a role to play:

* The Government: We could certainly have the government at the center.  In a sense The Fed does this today.  It is there 'job' to maintain liquid markets so that things don't go insane among the populace.  Things like the great depression make governing difficult.  Ultimately though, even liberals don't want governenment to be the centerpiece.  Liberals may want a strong government but it is usually to the end that it help the citizens.    The example of Soviet Communisim also wards us away from trying to put too much stock in the government as the ultimate center.
* The Market:  The economist will point to the market and say that it is the most pure incarnation and that the market will take care of itself. The market! The market!  But ultimately we have to make a choice.  The market is evolution businesfied.  It is cold, calculating and has no mercy.  Is that the choice we want to make?  It may be true that to date it has given the most benifit to the most people and generally pulled the least fortunate along for the ride, but I am going to reject the assumption that we can't do better.  Ultimately I think mercy and grace and redemption are worthwhile ideas.  The market has not use of these.
* The Company:  The legal entity has been an amazing tool of capitalism.  A tool where people are able to unite behind a purpose and pool resouces toward that goal is an amazing thing.  My problem with the company, at least in the modern C-corporation incarnation is that the those that run the company are always held to make choices with the best intrest of stockholder value in mind.  Even if those choices would destroy or disrupt other essential centers in the economy, ie. the market, the government, the well being of the people, the natural resouces, the board and the excutives cannot legally make the center preserving choice.  They must make the choice that maximises the shareholder's value.

We choose the citizen because without lifing up the citizen, the people, these other institutions are meaningless.  When these items have taken over in the past and become the end all be all, humanity has suffered.  Sometimes from war, sometimes from opression, sometimes from general lack of welfare.

I believe that if our system seeks to always put the citizen at the center then we will have created a succesful economic system and monetary policy.

## A new form of Money - Art
Around the center of the citizen we will add a new form of money. I propose to call this new coin 'Art' that has a stable value and conforms to my ideas of democratic hypercapitalism.

In short, this means that 'Art' can be

* traded for goods, but that in addition to the goods, the purchaser will be issued a form of prefered stock called 'prefs' equal to the number of 'Art coins' that are spent.
* 'demurraged' or 'degraded' as a natural course so that money cannot be horded and as a means to pay a dividend to 'pref' holders and to collect taxes.
* used as a form of voting in socieity in which citizens can 'veto' the power of a government accounts to transact business, in effect, demanding change or requiring the reformation of the agency under different governance.


Because of these properties, this form of money is a digital currency, issued under an issuing authority.  There are not physical bills.


## Citizen Accounts

This money will need to be held in 'accounts.'

Not all accounts will be equal.

Citizens will have citizen accounts.  These are the central accounts in the system.  These accounts have the most power and freedom with in the system.

An account will be issued to each 'citizen' that qualifed.  Typically this will be a resedient in a specific geographic area, although that definition may change over time.  It is a human being though, and not a group of humans.  One Citizen, one account.

## State Accounts

In my ideal scenario, the state is the issuer or the currency.  I do not expect this to be the way that things start out, but I think that for the near future, this should be an end goal.  I do not anticipate that humanity is quite ready to throw off the concept of the nation state.

The State will have an issuing account and its agencies will have agency accounts.  Sub governments like states and counties will have their own domain accounts and their sub agency accounts.

State accounts have the least amount of power because a group of citizens have the power to 'veto' the account and disable its use.  Until the state or its agency comply with the demands of the citizens, or until a larger group of citizens over turns the veto, the agency cannot do business.

## Legal Entitites

Legal Entities will have Legal Entity accounts.  Legal entity accounts have a bit less power than citizen accounts.  The cannot vote and cannot initiate private transactions.

## Transactions - Accountability and the Blockchain

Accounts will have a number of ways to transfer money around. Debit cards and online payment will be available.  Transfer will be as close to instant as possible.  Transaction blocks will be signed and pushed to a bitcoin like block chain that will ensure the validity of the transactions and keep the state from fudging the numbers behind the scenes.

The actual accounts will be under the central authority of the state and centralized.  The block chain will not be centralized and will be distributed across a pier to pier network.  In this way the entire transaction history will be stored off site and could be reconstructed in the event of catastrophe.

## Prefs

Each transaction will be accompanied by the transfer of prefs.  The central system will force accounts to catch up on a monthly basis, but generally accounts will catch up more often as they engage in commerce.

## A replacement for Commercial Banking

The issuing state will also regulate the loan pool.  Loan officers will bid for the rights to distribute the loans to the public.

## Inflation controls

A CPI authority will be in charge of regulating inflation by recommending adjustments to the Demurrage, Retaining, Issuance, and Pass Through Rates.  This authority will actually go out and buy a basket of goods in a broad set of geographic locations.  This will determine the inflation rate.  This number will strive to be as close to 0 as possible.

Out side of these bounds, commerce and markets will operate much as they do now free of over-regulation.

This 'dream state' is not easily achieved due to a number of assumptions that we will discuss in the next chapter.
