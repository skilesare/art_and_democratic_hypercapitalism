# Art - As Desired

If we had complete power to implement a system of our choice, what would it be and how would it work?

We will define this and discuss how we can start a movement toward that end result.

We want a coin called Art or ArtCoin that has a stable value and conforms to our ideas of democratic hypercapitalism.

The State will have an issueing account and its agencies will have agency accounts.  Sub governments like states and counties will have their own domain accounts and their sub agency accounts.

Citizens will have citizen accounts and Legal Entities will have Legal Entity accounts.

Accounts will have a number of ways to transfer money around. Debit cards and online payment will be availible.  Transfer will be as close to instant as possible.  Transaction blocks will be signed and pushed to a bitcoin like block chain that will ensure the validity of the transactions and keep the state from fuding the numbers behind the scene.

The actual accounts will be under a the central authority of the state and centralized.  The blockchain will not be cetralized and will be distributed across a pier to pier network.  In this way the entire transaction history will be stored off site and could be reconstructed in the event of catastrophy.

Each transaction will be accompanied by the transfer of prefs.  The central system will force accounts to catch up on a monthly basis, but generally accounts will catch up more often as they engage in commerce.

The issuing state will also regulate the loan pool.  Loan officers will bid for the rights to distribute the loans to the public.

A CPI authority will be incharge of regulating inflation by recommending adjustments to the Demurrage, Retaining, Issuance, and Pass Through Rates.  This authority will actually go out and buy a basket of good sin a broad set of geographic locations.  This will determine the inflation rate.  This nuber will strive to be as close to 0 as possible.

Out side of these bounds, commerce and markets will operate much as they do now free of overregulation.

This 'dream state' is not easily achieved due to a number of assumptions that we will discuss in the next chapter.
