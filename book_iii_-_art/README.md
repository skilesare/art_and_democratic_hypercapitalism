# Book III - Art

Our goal in this book is to outline a (re)genarative process that will allow our new form of money to become the dominant form of currency in the near future.  Much like our desire to have a life cycle to all things there will also be some outlets for the next thing to come along.  For example, our system would not work well for interplanetary or interstellar travel.  These are problems to solve another day.
