# Art and Democratic Hypercapitalism

In book I we take a look at the pattern language considered for this document

In book II we take a look at democratic hypercapitalism and analyze how it corrosponds to our chosen pattern language.  Here we build a form langage of items to use in the construction of our new form of money.

In book III we discuss a theoretical coin called 'art' which seeks to institutionalize hyper capitalism and bring about the end to taxes, deathless corporations, compulsuary employment and ensure social security and a thriving economy.  We seek to form a generative language to lead to the adoption of art as the dominant form of money.
