# EPI. Economic Piston

![THSimage](images/hvac_system.jpg)

**An Economic system cannot function unless it is driven by a piston that maintains the velocity of money so that inflation is controlled and yet there is all ways enough money to buy the outputs of production.**

If there is more money than output, prices will rise.  This leads to hyperinflation.

If there is more output than money then unemployeement will rise leading to a spiral of unemployment.

An economic system is subject to many outside forces that may rapidly swing the demands of a the system one way or another. (ie. War, Technology breakthrough)

A good economic system will be tolerant of these swings, a great system will thrive when they occur.

Therefore:

**Whenever possible, work toward the evolution of a thriving economic system, the economic piston, that will excel in balancing money supply and demands and push the flow of money at a rate that benifits the advancments of society.**


----------

Within the economy, encourage the participants to distribute themselves into States **(STA)**, Markets **(MKT)**, Legal Entities **(LGE)**, all made up of Citizens **(CTZ)**. These actors can participate in the economy by using Money **(MNY)** and by producing Capital **(CAP)**. The economy can be made more Anti-fragile by using Convex Transformation **(CVX)**.
