# WEL. Welfare

For the poor and uneducated the state should supply cash in the form of welfare.  As the poor spend this cash, they will earn prefs and should, after a time be able to maintain their own care.  In addition, once they educate and overcome their disadvantage, the state will recoup some of the cost by recieving pref payments from the citizens.
