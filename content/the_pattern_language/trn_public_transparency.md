# TRN. Public Transparency

... how can money help a state **(STA)** keep from abusing the Rule of Law **(ROL)**?

**The state can covertly operate and abuse the rule of law.**

A new form of money should both encourage rule of law, but also keep it in check when ever possible.

This can be accomplished by public transparency. If the government can neither take a payment or make a payment without being transparent with citizens.

If possible, our money should require state accounts to be open to scrutiney by all citizens.

Therefore:

**Require public transparency in accounts of the state.**

----------

Public transparency can be overseen by the citizen **(CTZ)**. Public transparency can be implementd via the Public Ledger **(PLG)**
