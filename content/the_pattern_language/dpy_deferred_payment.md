# DPY. Deferred Payment

... how can one exchange a good for the defered payment of money **(MNY)**?


**Often one wants to procure goods now with a promise to pay later.  Often called a loan.  How can currency accomplish this?**

Money is an effcient way to measure value.  Since unis of money are fungible, when one person offers X units for a good and another offers 2X, the good is measurabley more valuble to the second.  This may seem a silly example, but 2 cows are not necessarily more valuble than 1 cow.  The 2 may be unhealthy or a different breed.

As much as it can, a new form of money should maintain this property.  1 unit should always be half as valuble as 2 units of the same currency.

Therefore:

**Any form of money must be good for establishing Deferred Payment and as much as it can it should hold the value of the debt to be the same at the time of initiation as at the time of pay off.**

Defered Payment  is supported by  Rule of Law **(LAW)** and enforced by Legal Tender **(LTN)**. It can be made even sstronger when inflation and deflation are controled by Demurrage **(DMR)**
