# STH. Statutory Theft

... How do we use rule of law **(LAW)** to protect the citizen **(CTZ)** form losing his right to the full output of their labor **(FOL)**?

**As soon as someone has collected artificial capital in the form of prefs, others will scheme to take the future value from those not wise enough to understand the value of their capital.  How can we protect these people?**

Via rule of law we will need to create a crime similar to statutory rape that outlaws the setting up or taking of prefs, or the proceeds of prefs from a citizen.  Should this apply to entities as well?  Yes, through a chain, the prefs paid to entities have value to the citizens that have supported the entity.

How will this work?  This is a complicated issue and will need to be delt with carefully.  This is what we want to avoid:

A mother spends money to rais her children.  She accumulates a massive number of prefs over 20 years.  A 'banker' offers to buy the output of her prefs for $100,000.  All of her value is future value and the prefs are probabalistically worth more than that.  This person is trying to take advanatge of the mother's vulnerability.

The value of a pref is only bounded by the lifetime of an account.  Therefore the theoretical value is infinante.  Anyone trying to claim that value for a value less than infinante is stealing and should be held accountable by rule of law.

Therefore:

**Implement laws punishing the underpayment to accounts for the rights to their prefs.**
