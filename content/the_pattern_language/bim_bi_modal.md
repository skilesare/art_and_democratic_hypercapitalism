... how does one achieve a convex transformation?


**How can a system be adjusted in the manner of convex transformation.**


These Items are laid out in Taleb's Anti-fragile.  You should own this book.

Some things can be 'hedged' against. If a system is vulnerable to a particular type of volatility, often an offsetting piece can be added to the system that will move it from a concave distribution to a convex one. Adding a second mode gives the system a convex area in respect to that volatility.  No systems are completely anti-fragile, but adding a second mode can increase the ability of a system to prosper in the company of volatility.


Therefore:

**When you encounter a concave system entity, figure out how to add an element to the system that adds a convex area to the system.**
