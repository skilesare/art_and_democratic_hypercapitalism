# ACP. Artifical Capital


... what kind of Capital **(CAP)** is tied to real things?


**Not all capital is 'real' in that it can be touched in the physical world**

Real captial degratdes and requires continued investment. What about capital that does not degrade?  This is artifical capital.  Things like stocks and bonds are artificial capital.

Another way of saying this is that artifical capital is a 'contract' that has the potential to claim the right to the payment of cash or another asset.

Artifical capital does not need to be maintained.  It can be an imortal instrument.  As we have discussed with money, this is not an attractive quality for a thing to have.

Artificial capital should be limited in life as well.  We will discuss multiple methods on how this can be accomplished in later articles.  To summarize here they are:

1. Demurrage of Artifical Capital
2. Corporate Death
3. Taxation
4. Diminishing value of future superprofits



Therefore:

**Artifical Capital must be identifiable and must be forced to degrade or expire as all natural things do.**

----------

Artifical Capital can be controled via Demurrage **(DEM)**, Tax **(TAX)**, Diminishing value of future superprofits **(FSP)**, and Corporate Death **(KIL)**. Artificial Capital can be tracked in the Public Ledger **(PLG)**.
