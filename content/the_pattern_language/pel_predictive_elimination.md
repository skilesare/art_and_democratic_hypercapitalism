... how does one achieve a convex transformation?


**How can a system be adjusted in the manner of convex transformation.**



These Items are laid out in Taleb's Antifragile.  You should own this book.

It is often helpful to create convex systems if we go through a exercise in predictive elimination.  In this exercise we 'count something as loss' and then analyze how we would recover from that loss.

For example: Write your resignation letter the first day on the job.  When you get the big new client, what would you do if they don't pay their bills on time...or fire you.

In the framework of creating a new economic system we will work through exercies at the extreams to see what things do when variables are completely elimiated and/or completely saturated.


Therefore:

**When you encounter system entity that seems important, consider what would happen to the system if it wasn't there.**
