# Privacy Accounts

Privacy accounts are issued by the issuer to protect the right to privacy of its citizens.

We recommend one general privacy account that all private payments travel through.  This will maximize the privacy as the smaller number of transactions, the more likely a transaction can be deduced by process of elemination.

Legal Entities can recieve payments from privacy pools, but cannot issue payments to privacy pools.  This protects citizens from corporations that try to mask their finacnial dealings.

Payments from privacy accounts may take time to process and the system should wait for a substantial number of inputs and seprate the payments into chuncks that are distributed over time so that source and destination payments cannot be matched.

Privacy accounts may also have additional taxes on them.  Privacy is a right of the citizen, but that does not mean it has no cost.  Privae transactions between citizens could lead to black market activities that are detrimental to society, so a tax may be necessary to disuade the use of privacy accounts and provide for the enforcment of the rule of law.
