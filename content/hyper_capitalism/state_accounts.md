# State Accounts

There are two type of state accounts:

1. Issueing Accounts
2. Agency Accounts

There can only be one issuing accont.  This is the state agency(or corporation) issuing the currency. The currency's ability to function and the issuer's ability to uphold rule of law are key to an entity actually being able to support a currency.

An exampl of an issuing account would be The United States of America or The European Union.

A strong corporation could, for a time support a currency with the future view of nationalizing the currency when it gains enough steam to over ride the national currency.

Agency accounts are accounts that the Issuer can charter to offer public services and to opperate in the public interest.  These Accounts can collect Elective taxes.

Examples are a State government in the united state, a country account in the EU.  There can also be much smaller agencies.  A dock workers union account could be chartered and dock workers, and anyone wanting to support the dock workers could elect to pay taxes to the union and get a vote.  Agency Accounts have the power to select their members.

All type of state accounts will issue citizens the right to veto their ability to 'catch up.' If an account cannot 'catch up' then it cannot issue payment, recieve payment, or claim pref payments.  More will be discussed on this in the chapter on Veto.

Another feature of state accounts is that they cannot participate in the private pool for either recieving or transmitting payments.  All payments into out of the account will be free to view on the public ledger.
