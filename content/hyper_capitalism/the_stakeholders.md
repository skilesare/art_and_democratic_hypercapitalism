# The Stakeholders

Any system has a number of stakeholders.  The details of the system are all accidents of implementation.  The stakeholders and how the choices made in the system are the key the success of a system.

Our aim is for this system to be more 'fair'.  This is a complicated thing, but we think that the general term gets to the point.  We won't discuss specifics about what absolute fairness is, but we will discuss what is 'more fair' and 'less fair.'

Our goal is to create a system that is 'more fair' than the current system for as many stakeholders as possible.  When we reach a stakeholder where our system may impart some 'unfairness,' we hope to disapate some of that with a release valve that turns that percived unfairness into possible fairness.  No system is perfect, but this is our aim.

We will address the following Stakeholders:

1. The Laborer
2. The Capitalist
3. The State
4. The Debtor
5. The Creditor
6. The Loan Officer
7. The Company
8. The Union
9. The Single Mother
10. The Child
11. The Family
