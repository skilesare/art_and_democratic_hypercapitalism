# Prefs

Prefs are a form of prefered stock (thus 'prefs) that are issued to the buyer of good or service by the recieving account.  The issuing of this form of artifical capital is intrensic to the sytem.

The benifit of owning a pref is that the owners of a pref will recieve a dividend payment whenever cash 'demurrages' in an account.

This is the method that we have chosen to distribue to a citizen the full output of their labor.

This concept is based on the pattern 'predistribution of superprofits.'

The belief here is that as one participates in the economy, one should be rewarded when that participation leads to a growth in the economy.  Currently the economic rent that companies genrate goes to shareholders.  We are not against value added profit being distributed to shareholders, it is the economic rent, or the 'super profit' that leads to an imbalance in equality in a society.

We take economic rent as a reality. Perfect competition and perfect markets are not real.  When an economic rent is paid, we want that person who paid it to gain a future advantage.  This is the payment of the demurrage dividend.

Over a number of years of participating in the economy it is likely that a citizen will establish a sigifican flow of pref payments and will be free to pursue retirment and or a more fitting career free of the work of money.

How does this work in principal?  Say an account is catching up.  Its balance is $1000 and it has not caught up in a month.  The demurrage rate is 12% per year and thus the cash is demurraging 1% or $100. We will assume that taxes are 0% for this example.  If an account ownes 200 out of a total 2000 prefs in the demurraging account(10%), the owning account will recieve a $10 pref payment.  The demurraging accounts new balance is now $900 and it can send and recieve payment as well as claim any pref payments that have been sent to this account.
