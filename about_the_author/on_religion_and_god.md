# On Religion and God

I mentioned being a 'Alexandrian Presbyterian' earlier and I wanted to speak a bit more about that and the religious influence on this work.

I have tried to leave religion out of this work as much as possible.  At a certain base level though it is inseparable that this work has 'do unto others as you would have them do unto you' in it.  It is also seeks to be redemptive in nature in that this system for money will put forward a system that connects all of us in a deeper way than we currently are connected.

By membership I'm a member of a Presbyterian Church in America (PCA) church.  That is the conservative branch of the Presbyterian church.  My influences from the previous chapter have had some bearing on what I believe though and, specifically Christopher Alexander, have a lot to say about what and how I think we can really affect change in the world.

I believe that the Bible is the Word of God.  I also believe that it is the Word of God as is meant for a nomadic agrarian society.  I tend to read the Bible for what it says about God's character and less for how to go about living our daily lives.  I'm convinced that outside of basic relational directives it has very little that is relevant to modern life.  I'm not sure why God chose to stop speaking 2000 years ago but I think it is likely that a good bit of politics and power struggles went into changing the way we are listening.

In general, and my thoughts on this are in their infancy, I see a strong correlation between applying Alexander's 15 properties and redemption.  As I continue to study this becomes more clear to me.  The parallels between creating outside the bounds of wholeness and the idea of sin and the fall of man seems straightforward.

Take the following logic.  According to Alexander, the 15 properties are the way that 'nature' expands living systems.  If you extend this logic backwards you come to the realization that until intelligence, everything that happened was within this sphere of things.  Take as a set all things that could happen and as a sub set the things that were only done via the 15 wholeness preserving transformations.  The second set is much smaller, but until intelligence (whether that be human or pre-human) everything that had happened was in that smaller set.  Since intelligence we've managed to do many things outside of that 2nd set. In occurs to me that this may be the root of sin.  Making a decision and taking an action that reduces the inherent wholeness of the creation or our relationships.

The herculean effort of redeeming a system that has gone off the rails draws many parallels to the sacrifice that God deemed necessary at the Cross.  From the biblical time line, the death of Christ accomplishes the change in vector where everything moves back 'on the rails.'  That is where we are now.  Moving back toward the rails.  We are headed in the right direction but not there yet. In Eschatology(end times) circles this is akin to the amillinial view.  That is, we are already in the end times and God's grace is expanding even as evil continues to expand, but ultimately God's redemptive grace has the velocity advantage.  I don't know if it ends in a flash of light with evil being eradicated in an instant at a 2nd coming or if it will continue to be gradual and God will use his people and human weakness to move things forward as he has done for the last 2000 years.  I'd welcome the first but expect the second.

In our confession we say the chief end of man is to 'Glorify God and enjoy him completely.'  To me, this seems to be just what Alexander is getting at with his call to pursuing wholeness and enjoying the way that that wholeness seems to complete us as human beings.

Is God more like an otherworldly substrate that Alexander talks about in the Luminous Ground? I don't know, but I suspect God is and I think he is far closer than we think.  As we begin to pursue wholeness, I imagine he will make himself known more and more.

I'll leave religion to this section, but would love discussion from anyone reading and studying these things.
