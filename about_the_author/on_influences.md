# On Influences

The following influences are in no particular order.  I've included them because I think it is important to understand the lense that people see thorough when they are tring to think about an issue.

This should also serve as a bibliography. This is not an academic work and there are likely large sections I've just copied and pasted from elsewhere. If you find some text that I don't reference correctly, please submit a pull request.  I have an allergic reaction to the MLA.

I first read Alexander's Notes on Synthesis of Form in the late 2000s.  I didn't really know what I was reading at the time.  I rediscovered him later when trying to get to root of and better understand 'Patterns' in computer program with some prodding from a discussion of the architecture of Disney World.  His stuff made way more sense to me than anything that I had seen in computer science.  His 'difference' was that he looked at multiple levels of scale.  The patterns fit together in way that made sense and had a natural order to them.

His epic "Nature of Order" fundamentally changed the way that I look at the world.  It balanced the ideas I had about wanting to make things beautiful and worth living for with the order of systems that I was drawn to.  I cannot over emphasize the importance of these works and encourage everyone to read them.  They are about architecture but also much, much more than that.  They are about a life worth living and making sense of the mess that we have to approach every day.

He has influenced the structure of this book.  The Pattern Language -> Form Language -> Generative Language comes straight out of his work.  His process for creating a system is iterative and involves the following process:

**Alexanderâ€™s 10 structure-enhancing actions**

1. Step-by-step adaptation.
2. Each step helping to
enhance the whole.
3. Always making centers.
4. Allowing steps to unfold
in the most fitting order.
5. Creating uniqueness
everywhere.
6. Working to understand
needs of users.
7. Evoking & being guided by a
deep feeling of whole.
8. Finding coherent geometric
order.
9. Establishing a form language
that rises from & shapes
thing being made.
10. Always striving for simplicity
by which thing becomes
more coherent & pure.

I've tried to integrate Alexander's 15 fundamental properties of wholeness over money/marketplace and have arrived at the following:

1. Levels of Scale -> Economic Organization

2. Strong Centers -> Citizens Transactions

3. Boundaries -> Separation of Accounts

4. Alternating Repetition -> Money Life Cycle

5. Positive Space -> Market Satisfaction

6. Good Shape -> Fairness

7. Local Symmetries -> Transparency

8. Deep Interlock and Ambiguity -> Transaction Dependency

9. Contrast -> Identity

10. Gradients -> Disbursement

11. Roughness -> User Friendliness

12. Echos -> Patterns

13. The Void -> Legal Entities

14. Simplicity and Inner Calm -> Reliability

15. Not Separateness -> Elegance

Much of this comes from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1849963010/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1849963010&linkCode=as2&tag=everybase-20&linkId=RHMRVK5WVOOMCJF5">Thriving Systems Theory and Metaphor-Driven Modeling</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=everybase-20&l=as2&o=1&a=1849963010" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> by Lesllie Waugspeck about IT systems and I've tried to adapt it for money.

The ultimate goal here to implement a generative process to develop a new system of money by taking things one step at a time and then evaluating the resulting system for latent centers that can be strengthened to increase the wholeness of the system.  We've had to start somewhere so I've proposed the pattern language in Book I.  It isn't and should not be set in stone.  It can and should change as we all understand the moving pieces better.  I've also not included any of the scientific justification that Alexander did in his pattern language book.  It is essential that we build this together.

The consumption of all that Alexander has to say can take months.  I'd encourage to not delay and begin reading immediately.

**Nassim Nicholas Taleb**

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0083DJWGO/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0083DJWGO&linkCode=as2&tag=everybase-20&linkId=C7R7J2ZDKJM2AG3G">Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder (Incerto)</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=everybase-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B0083DJWGO" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

This particular book opened me up to paying attention to things that gain from disorder.  Our monetary system is not one of those things.  I don't want over state this as an influence, but I saw a lot of what Alexander was talking about in this book. Whole systems are anti-fragile.

In fact I have a theory that I'll throw out there but won't discuss much more.  Taleb says that in doing productive work, one should look for the 'free options.'  My theory is that if you take Alexander's 15 fundamental transformations, that either one of them is always a 'free' option, or at the other end that none of the 'life giving' options are free. The first theory would lead to a science where we can exponentially improve almost anything by following a set line of thinking.  The other is more likely and would state that 'ain't nothing free' and if you find something free, someone, somewhere (possibly you) are destroying wholeness.

In our discussion of money we will keep in the back of our heads, 'how does this deal with volatility.'  Our current system crashes and comes back slowly.  Can we soften the blows and increase adaptability of our monetary system?  That is what we will attempt to do.

I read this book in the early 2000s and it was probably the genesis of my political swing from conservative leaning to a more liberal stance.  It is a fascinating study into how wealth has concentrated in America.  It was also written almost a decade before Capital in the 21st century.

In my opinion this should be required reading for every American High School student.

**Howard Zinn**

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060838655/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0060838655&linkCode=as2&tag=everybase-20&linkId=EL6TU6DNQVPSAHOJ">A People's History of the United States: 1492 to Present</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=everybase-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0060838655" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

I'd heard a lot about Howard Zinn for a number of years as a Pearl Jam fan. "You can't be neutral on a moving train" from Down takes up some brain space in my head.  I hadn't read anything from him until I was writing the first draft of this document.  I listened to his People's History of the United States and it is probably the reason that the 'Democratic' part of 'Democratic Hypercapitalism' is in there.  It put the plight of the disenfranchised on my mind and caused me to put in the patterns on Human Dignity.  These are important things and should not be ignored when we talk about money.

This also should be required reading for High School students.

I don't know much about the man himself, but if you have event the slightest interest of what money is and how it works(and you are reading this...so...), this is a great, quick read that will give you the basics.  It will quickly dispel myths like 'we just keep printing money!' and 'back to the Gold standard!'  Listening to this lead to the patterns on issuing new money and how to manage that process.

The big take away was this: Inflation and deflation occur when there is an imbalance in the supply of money and the production of a society.  In other words, we can print as much money as we want as long as we can keep up with an equal amount of production.  Not only could we....but we have to to avoid a fluctuating currency.

This may be better in the Religion section, but studying this book in the late 90s lead to the construction of the idea that all value is future value.  Past value has little bearing on the situation. So when we talk about the 'right to the full output of labor' keep this in mind.  All remaining value is future value. You can't go back in time and reap additional value.

Mike is a bit controversial after drawing attention to labor conditions in China with a bit of bending of the truth.  His speech here led to my including ideas trying to remake banking into something a bit less blood sucking.  He is an amazing story teller and if you want some entertainment with a bit of thought involved he can provide hours of entertainment.  He is a bit crass at times if that kind of stuff bothers you.

Dr. Lessig's MayDayPac was the instigator for this entire undertaking.  In June of 2014 I was trying to push the Pac and get my friends and family to contribute.  I understood the fundamental reform that was necessary and I thought this Pac idea was a good way to get the reform done.  Leading up to the July 4th deadline to raise $5 million dollars it looked like the movement would fall short.  I started thinking about the problem and other ways to force institutional change.  My question became 'what if the way money works is really the problem?'  'If we can't change how the system uses money, can we change money?'  'Can we get to the root of this problem and force politicians to be accountable to the people they claim to represent and not the funders of political campaigns.  Ironically, I don't know that the system I've dreamed up here does much to change the way elections are funded.  It does try to give the power back to the people by allowing to them to block the operation of government institutions that they have a fundamental disagreement with.


**Francis Fukuyama**

Dr. Fukuyama's books are really interesting for anyone that engages in political thought.  The world would be a better place if everyone had to read them before gaining the right to vote.  In them we find the ammunition to ultimately reject the libertarian fallacy that is propagated by many  technocratic millionaires that may or may not live in Silicon Valley.

Fukuyama puts forward that three things are needed for advancing, productive political order:

1.  A strong State
2.  The rule of law
3.  Democratic Accountability

His works have caused me to back off some of the severity that the the democratic part of democratic hypercapitalism as originally architected. The govern must be strong, but also accountable.  We can't have people kneecapping the government at every turn of a hat.  As a result I've added gradated time periods for the democratic veto of accounts as the level of government gets bigger, the time periods to allowed to reverse the veto increase.

In addition, I hope that democratic hypercapitalism will overcome our tendencies to approach our economy in a patrimonial fashion while allowing us to maintain the patrimonial ties to family and friends that are key to our humanity.
