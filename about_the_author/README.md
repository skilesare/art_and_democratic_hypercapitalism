# About the Author

My name is Austin Andrew Fatheree. I was born in Houston, TX in 1977.  I have had a privelaged life.  Two parents who loved me and were able to make a good bit of money and inherit some more. We were far from 'ultrarich' but we had enough means to borrow enough money for me to go to private school most of my years.  There was a rough period around the savings and loan crisis, but over all I realize that I've had a more privelaged life than most who will read this book.

I went to The University of Texas. I started in Electrical Engineering and even qualifed to for the honors engineering program. After two years of doing electrical engeneering when I wanted to be doing computer engineering(and really not feeling like I was excelling) and doing my roommate's MIS homework, I transfered to the Managment Information Systems degree and graduated with a business degree.  This is instructive to show:

1. I'm kind of smart
2. But not smart enough
3. I know a good bit about computers
4. But way less than others.

I've worked for small consulting companies (Plan III), a small business (CourthouseDirect.com), A big 5 consulting company (Accenture) doing products and oil and gas work, a hedge fund (HBK) during the 2008 debacle, and 3D visualization start up (Aqumin), and finally started my own consulting company. I've done projects in Real Estate, Insurance, Oil and Gas, Refining, Construction, Cash and Collateral, Margin, Home Food Delivery, Guest Registries, Home owners associations, Medical condition tracking, and many others.  That is to say, I've done a little of a lot.

I've tried to 'start up' an education web product, a fake football league, a social networking organization platform, a competiton api, a travel tool for Walt Disney World, and a few other projects along the way.  They have mostly been complete and utter faiures.  Along the way I've realized that I'm never going to pull something off all by myself.  So I'm publishing this because I want to fix money and I need help doing so.

I'm an 'Alexadrian Prebyterian' by religion.  I'll talk more about what that is in a later section.  I think I made it up.

I'm married and have two kiddos and one on the way.  That is to say I've had to fit the development of these ideas in among a lot of other things.  I'd love to make this my life's work, but there are mouths to feed.  Please help out.

I don't know what I'm talking about.  I took microeconomics at UT but took a macro course a jr. college for credit.  I've tried to read a good bit and pick a few things up, but there is a high likelhood that I've gotten a number of things completely wrong.  Feel free to correct me.  This book is hosted on github and I take pull requests.

The thought that I might have something to say about the future of money is actually an absurd thought for me to consider, but, never the less, I've put together the because I just couldn't stop thinking about it.

I voted for Perot in '96, Bush in '00, Kerry in '04, Obama in '08 and '12.  That is to say I'm delusional, easily decieved, vengful, hopeful, and easily strung along.  Also my political alegience is all over the map.

I've always had a deep seeded distrust of capitalism, or at least capitalists.  I've seen the ease with which 'capitalists' point to capitalism to justify self serving behavir.  At the same time I see the complete failure of the centralization of power in socialism and communism.  I still have nieve sense that technology can overcome some of that power struggle with a little bit of transparency.

I first started think about this money stuff in 2009 after the banks started crashing and TARP was establised.  I read an article on hackernews about 'Free Money' and Silivio Gessell.  I was pretty facinated with the concept and the idea that the fact that money was 'immortal' was a big problem. I wrote some sweet 'fan fiction' where 'the world entered the current golden age by eliminating capitalism but preserved Freedom, Democracy, and the Free Market.'  And I guess that was the genesis of this.  I figure just because someone hadn't figure out a better way than capitalism didn't mean there wasn't a better way.  This anti-capitalism sentiment lingered for half a decade as my attention wandered elsewhere.

Sometime in 2014 I listened to Capital in the 21st Century by Piketty. This gave me a fresh 'big picture' perspective.  It brought me back to some of the ideas I'd had about money and the thought that the true root of 'capitalism' was the tendency for capital to conentrate.  What about capitalism where that wasn't possible?  Was it still capitlism?  I began to do some contrary thinking and think about what it would look like if 'everything' was capitalistic.  With this I've ended up at 'hypercapitalism'.

Around the same time Bitcoin was taking off. I came to understand some of the underlying technology and was intregued by some of the potential applications beyond currency.  I was distrustful of a currency base that had no way to 'grow' since I had some basic understanding of the pandora's box we've opened going to fractional reserve banking.  There is no way to put that genie back in the bottle without bloodshed.  I also had the perspective that the gold standard was as much of a ponzi scheme as the current system, just a different kind of one.

Seeing a chance to remake money I started outlining the reasons for doing so and what money was actully for.  To do this I relied a good bit on the frameworks put forward by Christopher Alexander in 'A Pattern Language' and 'The Nature of Order.'  I also keep in mind a good number of lessons learned from Taleb about the ideas of antifragility.  Neither of these are key to the discussion, but I think it is fair to name them as influences and disscuss them more in depth later.

I'm putting this out into the world because I don't have the technical expertise to pull it off my self.  I have seen the productivity that open source software can lead to and want to follow that model for developing this platform for a new kind of money.  Again, this is just the seed of an idea.  Some of my assumptions are certainly wrong and I'm open to correction.  Please submit pull requests.
