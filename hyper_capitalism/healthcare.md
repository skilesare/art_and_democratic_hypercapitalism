# Healthcare

Healthcare should be split into two forms, preventative health care, and end of life care.  We have already addressed end of life care in eldercare.  In that scenario, a person may procure care by electing to leave some of their prefs to caregivers as part of their legacy.

For preventative care, we will allow citizens to pay for health care by issuing prefs in their citizen accounts as payment to healthcare providers.  Since this process will reduce the pref payments owed to others that have paid the citizen economic rent, it should be severely restricted and regulated.  This should be a last resort measure in cases where not taking action will reduce the life expectancy and/or quality of life of the individual seeking care.
