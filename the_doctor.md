# The Doctor

Who: The doctor is an individual that is trained in medicine.  He may help the sick to get better or help the dying to die with dignity.

How will our system affect the doctor?  We offer a few different ways to help the doctor.  In the first case the doctor can go on charging cash for their services.  In a second case, a doctor may ask for prefs in the people they keep well.  In this way they can increase their future earnings in the same way that teachers will.  In the third instance where a person is dying and needs to be made comfortable, or where the person is at the end of thier life and will have little productivity ahead of them even if they have a temporary recovery, the patient can assign a set of prefs to passed to the doctor and/or caretakers as part of their legacy.
