# Art and Democratic Hypercapitalism

Why do we need a new form of money?  It is my belief that money is unnatural. It does not die and there for can lead to unfair advantage.  With art we seek to naturalize money and fix a lot of issues along the way.

Where will we end up?  With Art or ArtCoin as a new form of money.  This kind of money is differnt for 3 core reasons:

1. It has a property of demurrage.  Demurrage is controled inflation...aka, you must constantly spend money to keep your money 'current' and useable.
2. It demands that a form of artifical capital(aka prefs) be exchanged along with goods and services in exchange for money.  The Demurrage from money is paid out to owners of this capital.  Since no transaction can be performed without the transfer of capital we arrive at the name 'hypercapitalism'.
3. It allows tax payers the right to veto the use of state run accounts.  This is a form of ongoing voting that makes the people much more powerful in their self government and why this system is at its core 'democratic'


Thus Democratic Hypercapitalism.  ArtCoin is a proposed technical implementation.  There maybe others that are better but I feel like I should not present a problem with out some sort of solution proposed.

Why Art?  We propose that people should be 'compensated for the full out put of their labor'.  Their labor is their Art.  A unit of production echos into the future indefinantely and each laborer should have some right to the value produced from their own labor.

In book I take a look at the pattern language considered for this document.

In book II I take a look at democratic hypercapitalism and analyze how it corrosponds to our chosen pattern language.  Here we build a form langage of items to use in the construction of our new form of money.

In book III we discuss a theoretical coin called 'art' which seeks to institutionalize hyper capitalism and bring about the simplefication of taxes, the end of deathless corporations, the end of indentured employment, provide for the education of our children, empower democratic ideals of self government, increase transparency, enrich the laboring class, return the human capital wasted in the finance industry to progressive endevours, and ensure social security and a thriving economy.  We seek to form a generative language to lead to the adoption of art as the dominant form of money.
